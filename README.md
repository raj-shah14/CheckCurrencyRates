# CheckCurrencyRates
The program checks the rates of currency from the website "rates.fxcm.com"
It parses the rates using XML file which is obtained from rates.fxcm.com/RatesXML
The user can enter the currency pair from the website, and set a target rate. 
Once that target rate is achieved, he gets notified.
The code periodically checks for the rates for every 10 seconds.
